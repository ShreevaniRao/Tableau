# Using a sample Sales dataset of Tableau - Desktop
## I created an interactive Sales Dashboard that provides valuable insights into sales details. The dashboard consists of various worksheets designed to present key performance indicators (KPIs), a list of top customers, a comparison of sales details by month for different products, daily trends of sales for any selected month, and sales details segmented by products. -
* ### KPIs - for the top glance for quick & important metrics of overall sales performance for the stakeholders,
* ### List of Top Customers for targeted marketing campaigns and promotiona pitching
* ### Sales Details comparison of Products by Month which provides a visual representation of the sales performance of different products over time. This comparison aids in identifying trends, seasonality, and potential areas for product optimization or expansion.
* ### Daily trends of the Sales for any month to provide a granular analysis
* ### Sales details of Product Segments which provides a comprehensive understanding of the performance of different product categories, assisting in strategic planning, product positioning, and identifying areas for growth.
