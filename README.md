### Using Tableau - Desktop, I created multiple Dashboards - 
#### 1. Interactive Sales Dashboard that provides valuable insights into Sales detail of a sample Sales dataset. The dashboard consists of various worksheets designed to present key performance indicators (KPIs), a list of top customers, a comparison of sales details by month for different products, daily trends of sales for any selected month, and sales details segmented by products. -
* #### KPIs - for the top glance for quick & important metrics of overall sales performance for the stakeholders,
* #### List of Top Customers for targeted marketing campaigns and promotiona pitching
* #### Sales Details comparison of Products by Month which provides a visual representation of the sales performance of different products over time. This comparison aids in identifying trends, seasonality, and potential areas for product optimization or expansion.
* #### Daily trends of the Sales for any month to provide a granular analysis
* #### Sales details of Product Segments which provides a comprehensive understanding of the performance of different product categories, assisting in strategic planning, product positioning, and identifying areas for growth.

#### 2. Insightful YouTube Channel Performance Dashboard that explores some interesting insights from the stats and trends of a YouTube Channel

* #### I built multiple sheets to report KPIs and enhanced the insights with tooltips to demonstrate the details of the Youtube Videos and Shorts from a Channel.
* #### Explored the Correlation between the Video Length and View count of this Channel's regular videos and Shorts.
* #### Created an insightful and attractive dashboard to showcase the KPIs, multiple detailed insights of the Videos and Shorts about their View Count, Number of Likes, Comments and Engagement with the viewers. The Dashboard displays the Coorelation trend for the regular videos with respect to the length and view count.
* #### Ultimately the Dashboard suggests/recommends possible action items by detailing the Videos which have no Tags, are not performing well and disliked videos.
